This is an MT plugin for MemoQ 9.7 allowing users to use locally installed Ollama LLMs for machine-translation in MemoQ.

So far it has been tested on English to Polish translations using Mistral 7B, Llama2, and StableLM2. Out the three, the first one provided the best results. However, the prompt needs tweeking, and the plugin requires further testing.

Uses .NET 4.7.2 framework, and memoQ-MT-SDK-9.7.10.
